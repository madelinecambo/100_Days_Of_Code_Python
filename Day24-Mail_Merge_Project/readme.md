## Day 24 Project - Mail Merge Project

The main project for Day 24 involved writing a script that would automate the creation of Birthday Invites based on a list of names saved in a text file.
For this project I read in the names from a text file, then read in a template letter. Using the .replace() method I replaced the [name] field with the appropriate name.
I then saved the template letter to a ReadyToSendFolder which had the final complete personalized invitation for the Birthday Party.
