# Day 22 - The Classic Pong Game

For Day 22 I built the classic Pong game using OOP principles.

Class inheritance was used to create the Ball(), Paddle() and ScoreBoard() class which inherited all the methods and attributes from the Turtle() Class from the Turtle Graphics Module. 

#### Concepts
* Reading and understanding documentation
* Higher order functions and how to use them
* Object states and instances
* Creating classes and objects
* Understanding coordinate systems
* More experience using the Turtle graphics module
* Program and game design
* Class Inheritance
* More complex logic to control ball speed and animate bouncing 



## Day 22 Project - The Classic Pong Game

The main project for Day 22 involved creating a version of the Classic Pong Game. The game is now fully functional and allows 2 players to play Pong against eachother. 
Thee game starts with the ball moving towards the Right Player's screen. The Right player can control their paddle with the Up and Down arrow Keys. The Left Player can control their paddle with the "w" and "s" keys.

If either player missed the ball with the paddle then the other player wins a point. The Game continues indefinitely. 

The speed of the ball increases each time the ball hits one of the paddles to make the game more difficult for the players.
