# Day 35 - Keys, Authentication & Enviornment Variables 

For Day 35 I received more practice working with APIs and creating a weather notifier application. 

#### Concepts
* API endpoints
* Reading API documentation and making API calls with different parameters 
* Using Keys
* Environment Variables 
* Program Design
  

## Day 35 Project - USTA Tennis Team Email Weather App

The main project for Day 35 involved creating a weather application that checks the forecast for the next 12 hours and sends an email if it's forecasted to rain.
I extended this application to check if the feels like temperature would exceed the USTA Heat rule (100 degrees) or the USTA cold rule. 

This application will get a weather forecast and check the rain and feels like temperatures. 
If there is rain in the forecast or if the USTA temperature rules will be violated then the applicaiton will send an email informing about the upcoming conditions.
If the weather forecast is good for the matches and email will still be sent, informing of the good weather conditions and the forecast temperatures at the start of the matches. 

Environment variables were used to keep API Keys, locations, and passwords secure.
