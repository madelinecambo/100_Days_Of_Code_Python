# Day 25 - Working with CSV Data and the Pandas Library

For Day 25 I learned about working with CSV data and the Pandas library. The lesson started with using the native csv library and reading csv data. The lesson concluded with some basic data analysis using the Pandas module. 

#### Concepts
* Reading csv files
* Manipulating Pandas DataFrames
* adding custom shapes to the Screen object from the Turtle Graphics library
* Filtering Pandas DataFrames based on rows and columns
* Game Design
* OOP 

## Day 25 Project - U.S. States Naming Game

The main project for Day 25 involved creating a game for naming the US States. Each time a user guesses a State correctly that State name is written on the map and the states guessed correctly increments by 1. This continues until the user has guessed all 50 States.
