# 100 Days of Code: Day 42 - HTML Basics and Boilerplate

## Project Overview
**Date:** 8/24/2024

**Goal:**  
Today, I learned about the fundamentals of HTML, starting with the basic structure of an HTML document. I explored the HTML boilerplate, which includes the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration specifying that the document is written in HTML5, and the `<html lang="en">` tag indicating the language of the document's content.

A key concept covered was **nesting** in HTML, which I likened to a hamburger bun‚Äîeverything is sandwiched between opening and closing tags. Proper indentation is crucial to ensure the code is tidy and the nested elements are visually aligned, making it easier to understand the document's structure.

I also learned about working with lists in HTML. There are two types:

- **Unordered lists** (`<ul>`) for items where the order doesn't matter.
- **Ordered lists** (`<ol>`) for items that need to be in a specific sequence.

The individual items in these lists are marked with `<li>` tags.

In addition, I practiced creating links using the `<a>` tag. I discovered that simply using `<a>` doesn't create a hyperlink‚Äîyou must include the `href` attribute to define the link's destination.

Finally, I covered the `<img>` tag for embedding images in an HTML document. Unlike other tags, the `<img>` tag is a self-closing void element. I learned about the importance of the `alt` attribute, which provides alternative text descriptions for images, essential for accessibility, particularly for users who rely on screen readers.

Overall, today's focus was on understanding the foundational elements of HTML and ensuring my code is clean and well-structured.

## Project Details
### 1. Technologies Used
- **Language:** HTML
- **Tools:** VS Code

### 2. Project Description - HTML Birthday Invitation Project
Today, I worked on creating a birthday invitation using HTML. The project involved building a simple yet functional invitation page that included several key elements:

1. **List:** I included a list to highlight the important details of the event, such as the date, time, and location. I used an unordered list to present these details in a clear and organized way, ensuring that the information is easy to read and visually appealing.

2. **Image:** To make the invitation more lively and engaging, I added an image related to the birthday theme. I used the <img> tag to embed the image, which serves as a visual element to enhance the invitation's overall look and feel.

3. **Anchor Element:** Finally, I included an anchor element (<a> tag) to provide a clickable link for RSVPing or more event details. This element ensures that guests can easily access additional information or confirm their attendance with just a click.

Overall, this project was a practical exercise in applying basic HTML concepts to create a real-world item. It helped reinforce my understanding of how to structure and present content on a webpage effectively.

### 3. Resources

Today I learned about [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/200/) which is a website you can use to generate random placeholder photos during web development.
