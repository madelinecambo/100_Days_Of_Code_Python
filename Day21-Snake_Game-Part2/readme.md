# Day 21 - Build the Snake Game (Part 2): Class Inheritance and Slicing

For Day 21 I built the classic Nokia Snake game using OOP principles.

Class inheritance was used to create the Food and ScoreBoard class which inherited all the methods and attributes from the Turtle Class from the Turtle Graphics Module. 

#### Concepts
* Reading and understanding documentation
* Higher order functions and how to use them
* Object states and instances
* Creating classes and objects
* Understanding coordinate systems
* More experience using the Turtle graphics module
* Program and game design
* Class Inheritance
* Slicing Lists and Tuples 


## Day 20 Project - The Snake Game (Part 1)

The main project for Day 21 involved putting the finishing touches on the Classic Snake Game. The game is now fully functioning and works the same as the classic Nokia Snake Game.
When the game starts the snake is moving across the screen. The snake can be controlled with the arrow keys. Every time a piece of food is eaten, the snake grow by one segment.
The game continues until the snake collides with itself or with the wall.
