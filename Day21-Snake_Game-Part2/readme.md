# Day 21 - Build the Snake Game (Part 2): Class Inheritance and Slicing

For Day 21 I built the classic Nokia Snake game using OOP principles.

Class inheritance was used to create the Food and ScoreBoard class which inherited all the methods and attributes from the Turtle Class from the Turtle Graphics Module. 

#### Concepts
* Reading and understanding documentation
* Higher order functions and how to use them
* Object states and instances
* Creating classes and objects
* Understanding coordinate systems
* More experience using the Turtle graphics module
* Program and game design
* Class Inheritance
* Slicing Lists and Tuples
* Opening and Writing Files to persist the High Score


## Day 21 Project - The Snake Game (Part 2): Class Inheritance and Slicing

The main project for Day 21 involved putting the finishing touches on the Classic Snake Game. The game is now fully functioning and works the same as the classic Nokia Snake Game.
When the game starts the snake is moving across the screen. The snake can be controlled with the arrow keys. Every time a piece of food is eaten, the snake grow by one segment.
The game continues until the snake collides with itself or with the wall. 

On Day 24 additional game functionality was added that saves the highest score as a text file. This high score will be loaded each time the game is run so the player can compete against their own highest score.
