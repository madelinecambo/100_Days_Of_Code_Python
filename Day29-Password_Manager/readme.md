## Day 29 Project - Password Manager GUI Application

The main project for Day 29 involved building a password manager to generate and store secure password for websites. 
The application is prepopulation with a username (email) and the prompts the user to enter the Website name and push the Generate Password button to generate a secure password.
Once the password is generated the user has the option to Add the password, which will save it as a text file. 
Once as secure password is generated its also copied automatically to the clipboard for easy pasting into the applicable website.
