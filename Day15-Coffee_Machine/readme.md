# Day 15 - Coffee Machine Project

For Day 15 I built another capstone project that involved making a virtual coffee machine. 

#### Concepts
* global vs local scope
* writing functions
* conditional statements (if/elif/else)
* while loops
* flow chart programming

## Day 15 Project - Coffee Machine

The virtual coffee machine will ask a user for their beverage choice. The program will then check if there are sufficient resources to make the user's beverage. If so, the program will ask the user to input money, check that enough was deposited and make the beverage deducting the ingredients needed from the machine resources.
