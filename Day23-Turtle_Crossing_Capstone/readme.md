# Day 23 - Turtle Crossing Game

For Day 23 I built a Turtle Crossing game that resembles the Frogger game. 


#### Concepts
* Reading and understanding documentation
* Higher order functions and how to use them
* Object states and instances
* Creating classes and objects
* Understanding coordinate systems
* More experience using the Turtle graphics module
* Program and game design
* Class Inheritance
* More complex logic to control the behavior of multiple instances 



## Day 23 Project - Turtle Crossing Game

The main project for Day 23 involved creating a version of the Frogger Game.  
The goal is to cross the road without coming into contact with any of the cars. The player can move the turtle forward using the Up key.
Once the turtle crosses the road, the level will increase, and the car speed will increase as well.
