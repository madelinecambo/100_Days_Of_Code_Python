## Overview

For day 8 we learned how to write more complex functions with multiple arguments. The final project was a Caesar Cipher that could encode and decode text by shifting the alphabet by a user defined amount.

### Skills Acquired
* Functions with multiple arguments
* How to write a more complex program
* Practical For Loops with a program
* How to debug and problem solve
* How to consolidate multiple functions into one to simplify code
* lists and list indexing
