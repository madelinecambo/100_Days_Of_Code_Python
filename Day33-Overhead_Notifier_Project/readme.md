# Day 33 - API Endpoints and API Parameters 

For Day 33 I learned about API endpoints, how to acess them, and how to submit API calls with parameters. 

#### Concepts
* API endpoints
* How to make API calls with parameters
* How to work with JSON objects from data receivedg from API calls 
* How to use datetime module
* How to use time.sleep()
  

## Day 33 Project - International Space Station (ISS) Notifier 
* The main project for Day 33 involved creating an ISS tracker that will send an email notification when the ISS is overhead and it's night time.
* To create this tool I used an API to get the current location of the ISS. I also used another API to get the sunset and sunrise times of my current location.
* Using both pieces of information I wrote a conditional function that will send an email when it's night time and the ISS is overhead in the sky.
