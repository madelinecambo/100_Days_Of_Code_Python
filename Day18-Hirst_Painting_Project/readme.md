# Day 18 - Damien Hirst Dot Painting

For Day 18 I created a Damien Hirst Dot Painting using OOP principles.  

#### Concepts
* Reading and understanding documentation
* Creating classes and objects
* Utilizing OOP principles to structure my code efficiently
* Using libraries like Turtle graphics, colorgram and random to generate and plot the dots.
* Enhancing my skills in loops, conditionals, and function definitions.


## Day 18 Project - Hirst Dot Painting

Used the Turtle Graphics library to create a version of a Damien Hirst dot painting that is sized 10 x 10.
