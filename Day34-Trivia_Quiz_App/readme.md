# Day 34 - API Practice - Creating a GUI Quiz App

For Day 34 I received more practice working with APIs and created a GUI Quiz App that has trivia questions pulled from The Open Trivia Database. 

#### Concepts
* API endpoints
* Reading API documentation and making API calls with different parameters 
* Unescaping HTML Entitities 
* Type Hints and Arrows
* Review of working with Classes
  

## Day 34 Project - Trivia Quiz App
* The main project for Day 34 involved modifying the previous Trivia Quiz App to be GUI based. 
* Previously created classess needed to be modified to accept Trivia questions from an API call to the Open Trivia Database.
* Each time the quiz is started a list of 10 new questions will populate the application.
* The trivia quiz app works the same as before, but now displays all feedback in the GUI App itself.
