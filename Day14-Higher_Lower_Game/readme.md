# Day 14 - Higher or Lower Game Project

For Day 14 I built another capstone project that leveraged everything I've learned so far. 

#### Concepts
* global vs local scope
* writing functions
* conditional statements (if/elif/else)
* while loops
* flow chart programming

## Day 14 Project - Higher or Lower Game

Created a game that prompts the user to guess who has the most social media followers and then awards points if the user guesses correctly.
