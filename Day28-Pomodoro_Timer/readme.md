# Day 28 - Tkinter, Dynamic Typing and the Pomodoro GUI Application

For Day 27 I learned how to use the Tkinter library more extensively, learned about dynamic typing and built a Pomodoro GUI Application. 

#### Concepts
* Tkinter
* How to create a GUI application using labels, buttons and grid layout
* How to design a GUI application
* How to build the Pomodoro Application 

## Day 28 Project - The Pomodoro GUI Application

The main project for Day 28 was a Pomodoro GUI Application that works as a fully functional Pomodoro timer. At the end of each work period a check mark shows up to mark the progress. 
The timer works like a traditional Pomodoro Timer:
* Work Block (25 min)
* Short Break (5 min)
* Repeat 4x 
* Long Break (20 min)
* ...
