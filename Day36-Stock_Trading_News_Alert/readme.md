## Day 36 - Stock Trading News Alert Projrect

For Day 36 I received more practice working with APIs and creating another application for sending alerts. 

#### Concepts
* API endpoints (News and Stock Endpoints)
* Reading API documentation and making API calls with different parameters 
* Using Keys
* Environment Variables 
* Program Design


### **Day 36 Project** - Stock Trading Alert Application

The main project for Day 36 involved creating a Stock Trading Alert Application. 
Based on a stock ticker symbol and company name the application will grab yesterday's and the day before's closing stock price.
If there the closing stock price has changed by more than 5% then the application will email an alert and include the three top headlines for that company. 

Environment variables were used to keep API Keys, locations, and passwords secure.
