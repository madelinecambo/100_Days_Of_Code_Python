## Day 12 Project - Guess A Number Game

Created a game that allows the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. The user can select from difficulties easy (5 attempts) or hard (10 attempts). Each time the computer gives the user feedback regarding their guess. The user wins if they guess the correct number within the designated number of attempts.
