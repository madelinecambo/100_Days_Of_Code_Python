# 100 Days of Code: Day 51 - Automated Twitter Complaint Bot

## Project Overview
**Date:** 09/11/2024

**Goal:** 
Today, I developed an automated Twitter bot that monitors my internet speed and tweets a complaint to AT&T whenever the speed falls below the contracted rate.

## Project Details
### 1. Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Selenium
- **Tools:** PyCharm, Twitter Developer API

### 2. Day Overview 
#### Introduction to the Project
- **Automated Complaint Bot**: The goal was to create a Python script that runs periodically to check my internet speed. If the speed falls below a certain threshold, the bot automatically tweets a complaint to AT&T, ensuring that I stay on top of my service quality without manual effort.

#### Setting Up the Bot


- **Speed Testing**:
  - I used the speedtest.net website to measure the current download and upload speeds.


#### Automating the Complaint
- **Logic for Tweeting**:
  - The bot compares the current speed against the contracted rate.
  - If the speed falls below the threshold, the bot constructs a complaint tweet and posts it to AT&T's Twitter handle.

- **Customizable Message**:
  - The tweet message is customizable, allowing it to express dissatisfaction in a professional tone while including the measured speed and the expected speed for clarity.

### 3. Challenges and Learning
- **Challenges Faced:**
  - Twitter detected abnormal activity and immediately added an additional step for logging in

### 4. Final Project - Automated Twitter Complaint Bot



#### Objective
The objective of this project was to automate a repetitive task—complaining about slow internet speeds—using Python. This project not only enhances productivity but also serves as a practical application of API integration and automation.
