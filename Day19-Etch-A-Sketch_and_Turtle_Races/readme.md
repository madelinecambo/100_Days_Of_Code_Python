# Day 19 - Damien Hirst Dot Painting

For Day 19 I created an Etch-A-Sketch Game and a Turtle Racing Game using Object Oriented Programming concepts. 

#### Concepts
* Reading and understanding documentation
* Object states and instances
* Creating classes and objects
* Understanding coordinate systems
* More experience using the Turtle graphics module
* Program and game design 


## Day 19 Project - Etch-A-Sketch and Turtle Racing Game 

The main project for Day 19 involved creating a Turtle Racing Game. The user is prompted to bet on a Turtle. The turtles then line up and the race is off. At the end of the race, the user is told if they've won or lost based on their bet.
