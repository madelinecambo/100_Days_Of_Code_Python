# 100 Days of Code: Day 44 - Intermediate CSS

## Project Overview
**Date:** 8/25/2024

**Goal:**  
Today's focus was on intermediate CSS concepts, where I delved deeper into styling techniques and tools for enhancing web design.

## Project Details
### 1. Technologies Used
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS
- **Tools:** VS Code

### 2. Key Topics Covered

#### **Color Properties**
- I learned how to set background and text colors using CSS. For example:
  - The entire webpage's background can be colored using the `background-color` property applied to the `html` element.
  - The color of headings can be customized, as demonstrated with the `h1 { color: blue; }` property.
  
- **Hexcodes and RGB**: I explored using hex codes and RGB values for more precise color control. Hexcodes provide a way to represent specific colors, while RGB uses values out of 255 for red, green, and blue components.

- **Color Resources**:
  - **ColorHunt.co**: A tool for finding unique color palettes, useful for creating professional and visually appealing websites.
  - **Mozilla Developer Docs**: An excellent resource for understanding named colors in CSS.

#### **Font Properties**
- **Font Size**: I reviewed different units for font sizing, including:
  - `px` (pixels)
  - `pt` (points)
  - `em` (relative to the parent element)
  - `rem` (relative to the root element)

- **Font Weight**: CSS allows for the specification of font weight using keywords (like `bold`), relative values, or numeric values ranging from 100 to 900.

- **Font Family**: I practiced defining the font family for text, which includes specifying a primary typeface and fallback options. For example:
  - `font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;`
  
  Additionally, I explored serif and sans-serif fonts, with serif fonts featuring "feet" around the letters.

- **Text Alignment**: The `text-align` property was used to control text alignment, such as centering headings with `text-align: center;`.

#### **Inspecting CSS**
- **Chrome Developer Tools**: I learned how to use Chrome's built-in developer tools to inspect and debug CSS. The **CSS Inspector** and **Computed** tab help in viewing the applied styles and understanding how CSS rules are affecting elements on the page.

#### **The Box Model**
- I explored the CSS box model, which includes:
  - **Margins**, **Padding**, and **Borders**: These properties define the space around elements, inside elements, and the border itself.
  - Rules for defining borders were practiced, such as setting border width and adjusting padding to influence the spacing within and around elements.

#### **Content Division Element (`<div>`)**
- **Div Elements**: I worked with `<div>` tags, which act as invisible containers for grouping content. These can be styled with CSS to organize and format the layout of web pages effectively.

#### **Pesticide Chrome Extension**
- This tool was introduced as a way to help with debugging CSS. It highlights the box model for all elements on the page, making it easier to see and adjust margins, padding, and other layout properties.


### 3. Final Project - CSS Styling for Spanish Colors Learning Website

For the final project, I worked on creating a website designed to help users learn colors in Spanish. The primary focus was on applying CSS to style the website, making it both visually appealing and functional for language learners.

The website included the following elements:

- **Color Names in Spanish**: The core content of the website consisted of a list of colors with their corresponding names in Spanish. Each color name was displayed alongside a colored block to visually represent the color, helping users make a direct connection between the word and the visual color.

- **CSS Styling**: I applied various CSS techniques to enhance the learning experience:
  - **Background Colors**: Each color name was paired with a background color matching the color it represents. This created a clear and intuitive learning interface.
  - **Typography**: I used specific fonts and text styling to make the color names stand out, ensuring they were easy to read and aesthetically pleasing.
  - **Responsive Design**: The CSS was designed to ensure that the website was responsive, meaning it would look good on various devices, from desktops to smartphones. This was important for making the learning tool accessible to a wide audience.

- **Interactive Elements**: To further engage users, I included interactive elements such as hover effects that changed the appearance of the color blocks or text when users moved their mouse over them. This added a layer of interactivity that made the learning experience more dynamic and engaging.

Overall, the project combined practical CSS skills with a real-world application, resulting in a user-friendly educational tool that helps users learn and remember colors in Spanish through a well-styled and interactive web interface.
