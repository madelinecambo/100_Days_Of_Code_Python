# 100 Days of Code: Day 49 - LinkedIn Job Application Bot

## Project Overview
**Date:** 8/31/2024

**Goal:** 
Develop a bot to automate the job application process on LinkedIn, aiming to streamline and speed up the application process.

## Project Details
### 1. Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Selenium
- **Tools:** WebDriver, Browser

### 2. Day Overview 
#### Project Development
- **Bot Functionality:** The goal was to create a bot that could automatically apply to jobs on LinkedIn, reducing the manual effort involved in the job search process. The bot was designed to navigate LinkedIn, search for relevant job postings, and apply to them automatically.

- **Challenges Faced:**
  - **No One-Step Apply Jobs:** One significant challenge encountered was the lack of "one-step apply" jobs on LinkedIn. Each job application required customization, which meant that full automation was not feasible. The bot could navigate to the job listings, but the application process had to be customized manually for each job.

- **Customization Issues:** Due to the need for customization in the application process, the bot's automation capabilities were limited, which affected the overall effectiveness of the project.

### 3. Day 49 Project - LinkedIn Job Application Bot

The primary project for Day 49 was to build a LinkedIn Job Application Bot. The bot was designed to automate the job application process on LinkedIn, but due to the necessity for job-specific customization, full automation was not possible.

#### Project Overview
- **Functionality:** The bot was capable of searching for jobs, navigating to job postings, and beginning the application process. However, it could not complete the application automatically due to the variability in application forms.

#### Objective
The objective was to automate as much of the job application process as possible on LinkedIn, but challenges related to the need for customization in job applications limited the bot's capabilities.
