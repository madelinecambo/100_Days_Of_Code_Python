# Day 32 - Send Email (smtplib) & Manage Dates (datetime)

For Day 32 I wrote a script that will automatically send Happy Birthday Emails to contacts in a csv file on the day of their Birthday. I learned to automate this program to run daily using PythonAnywhere.com

#### Concepts
* smtplib library
* How to create a password for an App in the Gmail Settings
* How to automate a python script to run daily using Python Anywhere
* How to use datetime module 
  

## Day 32 Project - Birthday Emailer 
* The main project for Day 32 I wrote a script that would read Birthdays in a csv file, and then send Happy Birthday Emails to the applicable recipients.
* There are three letter templates that are randomly chosen so the Birthday Person doesn't catch on that the email is automated.
* The Birthday Person's name is replaced in the template and the Happy Birthday Email is sent out.
* I scheduled this script to run daily at 12pm using Python Anywhere.
