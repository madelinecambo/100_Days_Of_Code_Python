# Day 31 - Flash Card Application Capstone Project

For Day 31 I built a Flash Card Program for reviewing data science concepts for interviews. I put together everything I've learned so far to build this program. 

#### Concepts
* Exception Handling
* Reading, writing and updating csv files
* Working with JSON data

## Day 31 Capstone Project - Data Science Interview Concept Flashcards 

* The main project for Day 31 involved creating a Flash Card program for reviewing important data science concepts that frequently come up in inteviews. Chat GPT generated a csv file with the most common data science interview concepts.
* I created a Flash Card program using Tkinter to review the concepts.
* After 3 seconds the answer to the card will be automatically displayed.
* The User can select the Check Mark if they know the concept and the card will be removed from the deck. If the user selects the X button then the card will be added back to the deck.
